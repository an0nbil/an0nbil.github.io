I'm **Bilal Safdar**, known online as **"an0nbil"**, a cybersecurity specialist and bug bounty hunter from Pakistan. I hold certifications in Ethical Hacking Essentials (EHE) and am a Python developer. My journey in cybersecurity has led to recognition, including being featured in NASA's Hall of Fame for ethical hacking achievements. 

I actively contribute to the InfoSec community by writing articles on [Medium](https://an0nbil.medium.com/), sharing insights on topics like bug hunting, reconnaissance methodologies, and ethical hacking roadmaps. 

My work has been acknowledged by platforms such as the OSINT Team, where my articles have ranked among the most read. 

In addition to writing, I develop tools to aid in security testing. One such tool is [**Dekon**](https://github.com/an0nbil/dekon), designed for generating and utilizing categorized Google Dorks, enhancing OSINT and security testing processes. 

I also engage with the community through platforms like GitHub, where I share my projects and collaborate with others, and Twitter, where I discuss cybersecurity topics and share updates. 

My passion for cybersecurity drives me to continuously learn and share knowledge, aiming to contribute to a safer digital world.
